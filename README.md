# awesome-engineering

This is an attempt to aggregate mentorship offers from experienced engineers towards worldclass project ideas for young engineers to try.

This repo was inspired from [this tweet](https://x.com/codepetence/status/1803106739686133969) which bemoaned that most beginning software engineers are building cookie-cutter / tutorial-style projects for their CVs, instead of hard and novel projects that demonstrate their ability to do real engineering and also signal their genuine curiosities. 

I invite other experienced engineers to offer mentorship for worldclass project ideas to young ones who have demonstrated genuine intent. Good ideas are those which you are currently exploring yourself. You simply take a few more people along with you. To suggest a new project, you can create an issue in this repo with a detailed description of the project and add appropriate labels. 

## Project ideas with mentoring offered:
