# awesome-engineering

This is an attempt to aggregate mentorship offers from experienced engineers towards worldclass project ideas for young engineers to try.

This repo was inspired from <a href="https://x.com/codepetence/status/1803106739686133969" target="_blank">this tweet</a> which bemoaned that most beginning software engineers are building cookie-cutter / tutorial-style projects for their CVs, instead of hard and novel projects that demonstrate their ability to do real engineering and also signal their genuine curiosities. 

I invite other experienced engineers to offer similar mentorship for worldclass project ideas. You can create an issue in this repo with a detailed description of the project and add appropriate labels. 

## Project ideas with mentoring offered:

- [ARC-AGI Solver by inducing tactics and curriculum learning as in Peano](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/awesome-engineering/issues/1) (machine learning, python, rust) - mentoring by [@nileshtrivedi](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi)
